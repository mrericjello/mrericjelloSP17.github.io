                <figcaption>In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: a human who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. When terrorism reaches a new level that includes the ability to hack into people's minds and control them, Major is uniquely qualified to stop it. As she prepares to face a new enemy, Major discovers that her life was stolen instead of saved. Now, she will stop at nothing to recover her past while punishing those who did this to her.</figcaption>

                <p>A flimsy copy of a copy, one that recreates some of the anime's set-pieces nearly shot for shot, but then pares away nearly everything else that made the original a classic.</p>

                <p>"Adapting Japanese anime can be tricky, as the dialogue and mannerisms of the characters can seem otherworldly to American audiences. Ghost in the Shell is one of those adaptations where it's abundantly clear how difficult it was for the filmmakers to tackle." - Kadiro</p>
                <p>"There's a lot more wrong then there is right with this movie. An oversimplistic sci-fi that fails to hit the mark." - Baratta</p>
